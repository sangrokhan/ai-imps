# AI Implementation Framework (AI-IMPS)

A modular framework for implementing and experimenting with AI research papers.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand the system design.
2. If you are an AI agent, follow the [AGENT_GUIDE.md](AGENT_GUIDE.md) for implementations.
3. Check [implementations/](implementations/) for existing paper implementations.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `core/`: Abstract base classes and registry system.
- `common/`: Shared layers, loss functions, and utilities.
- `runners/`: Standard execution engines (Supervised, RL).
- `implementations/`: Specific paper implementations.
- `configs/`: Configuration management.

## 🛠️ Usage
(Coming soon: Example command to run an implementation)
```bash
# Example: python main.py --config configs/den_iclr2018.yaml
```
